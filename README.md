Brief

We are developing a web app that will revolutionise A&E waiting times. This will be able to give patients recommendations at home, pool their details to hospital databases before they
have arrived, allow them to insert their own presenting complaint, take photographs and deliver speech text. This information will be devlivered to a nurses device, where they can input 
vital signs and medical data, which will then be combined with the patient details to generate an AI recommendation as to discharge, referral to another specialty or an emergency response.
